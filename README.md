## Overview
In today’s fast-paced technology market, a laptop's price is influenced by an intricate balance of hardware specifications, market trends, and consumer demand. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a market analyst, understanding what drives these prices can offer valuable insights. In this project, we dive deep into a comprehensive dataset of laptop listings to uncover the key factors that determine pricing.

Imagine being able to predict whether a laptop's price will be premium or budget-friendly simply by analyzing its features—processor, RAM, storage, and more. By leveraging exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and a suite of predictive models, this project aims to not only forecast prices but also shed light on which attributes contribute most to cost variations.

The challenge is to explore the data, refine the features, and construct robust models that capture the intricate dynamics of laptop pricing. By building an interactive Streamlit app, users can input their laptop specifications to receive a predicted price, visualize trends, and even download customized data views for further analysis.

Disclaimer: The dataset sourced from Kaggle may contain anomalies or inconsistencies typical of real-world data. The analysis and predictions are intended for educational and exploratory purposes only.
